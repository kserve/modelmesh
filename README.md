# ModelMesh

The ModelMesh framework is a mature, general-purpose model serving management/routing layer designed for high-scale, high-density and frequently-changing model use cases. It works with existing or custom-built model servers and acts as a distributed LRU cache for serving runtime models.

See these [these charts](https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh/files/8854091/modelmesh-jun2022.pdf) for more information on supported features and design details.

For full Kubernetes-based deployment and management of ModelMesh clusters and models, see the [ModelMesh Serving](https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving) repo. This includes a separate controller and provides K8s custom resource based management of ServingRuntimes and InferenceServices along with common, abstracted handling of model repository storage and ready-to-use integrations with some existing OSS model servers.

### Quick-Start

1. Wrap your model-loading and invocation logic in this [model-runtime.proto](./src/main/proto/current/model-runtime.proto) gRPC service interface
    - `runtimeStatus()` - called only during startup to obtain some basic configuration parameters from the runtime, such as version, capacity, model-loading timeout
    - `loadModel()` - load the specified model into memory from backing storage, returning when complete
    - `modelSize()` - determine size (mem usage) of previously-loaded model. If very fast, can be omitted and provided instead in the response from `loadModel`
    - `unloadModel()` - unload previously loaded model, returning when complete
    - Use a separate, arbitrary gRPC service interface for model inferencing requests. It can have any number of methods and they are assumed to be idempotent. See [predictor.proto](src/test/proto/predictor.proto) for a very simple example.
    - The methods of your custom applier interface will be called only for already fully-loaded models.
2. Build a grpc server docker container which exposes these interfaces on localhost port 8085 or via a mounted unix domain socket
3. Extend the [Kustomize-based Kubernetes manifests](config) to use your docker image, and with appropriate mem and cpu resource allocations for your container
4. Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster as a regular Service, which will expose [this grpc service interface](./src/main/proto/current/model-mesh.proto) via kube-dns (you do not implement this yourself), consume using grpc client of your choice from your upstream service components
    - `registerModel()` and `unregisterModel()` for registering/removing models managed by the cluster
    - Any custom inferencing interface methods to make a runtime invocation of previously-registered model, making sure to set a `mm-model-id` or `mm-vmodel-id` metadata header (or `-bin` suffix equivalents for UTF-8 ids)

### Deployment and Upgrades

Prerequisites:

-   An etcd cluster (shared or otherwise)
-   A Kubernetes namespace with the etcd cluster connection details configured as a secret key in [this json format](https://github.com/IBM/etcd-java/blob/master/etcd-json-schema.md)
    -   Note that if provided, the `root_prefix` attribute _is_ used as a key prefix for all of the framework's use of etcd

From an operational standpoint, ModelMesh behaves just like any other homogeneous clustered microservice. This means it can be deployed, scaled, migrated and upgraded as a regular Kubernetes deployment without any special coordination needed, and without any impact to live service usage.

In particular the procedure for live upgrading either the framework container or service runtime container is the same: change the image version in the deployment config yaml and then update it `kubectl apply -f model-mesh-deploy.yaml`

### Build

Sample build:

```bash
GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
BUILD_ID=$(date '+%Y%m%d')-$(git rev-parse HEAD | cut -c -5)
IMAGE_TAG_VERSION=0.0.1
IMAGE_TAG=${IMAGE_TAG_VERSION}-$(git branch --show-current)_${BUILD_ID}

docker build -t model-mesh:${IMAGE_TAG} \
    --build-arg imageVersion=${IMAGE_TAG} \
    --build-arg buildId=${BUILD_ID} \
    --build-arg commitSha=${GIT_COMMIT} .
```
